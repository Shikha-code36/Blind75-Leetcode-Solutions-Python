#Solution1
def twoSum(nums, target):
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                  if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                        return [i,j]
#T:O(N^2)
#S:O(1)

#Solution2 hashmap
#use hash map to instantly check for difference value, map will add index of last occurrence of a num, donâ€™t use same element twice
def twoSum(nums, target):
    dict = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        diff = target - nums[i]
        if diff in dict:
          return [dict[diff], i]
        dict[nums[i]] = i

# T: O(N)
# S: O(N)
